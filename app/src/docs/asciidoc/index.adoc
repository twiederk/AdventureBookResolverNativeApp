== Panels

* Panels are parts of fragments.
* Panels have their own layout file, which is imported in the fragments layout file.
* Panels are injected by member injection into fragments using Koin.
* Game is injected by constructor injection into panels using Koin.
* Listeners of the panel are implemented as classes in same file as the panel.
* Listeners receive game as constructor parameter, but it is not injected by Koin.
* Panels implement the Panel interface.
