== Koin

The https://insert-koin.io/[Koin] framework is used for dependency injection.
The context is stored in the appModule value and is created in the KoinConfiguration file.

Tests using the Koin framework extend the KoinTest class and use the suffix KoinTest.

== Panels

* Panels are parts of fragments.
* Panels have their own layout file, which is imported in the fragments layout file.
* Panels are injected by member injection into fragments using Koin.
* Game is injected by constructor injection into panels using Koin.
* Listeners of the panel are implemented as classes in same file as the panel.
* Listeners get their dependencies injected by Koin, thus they're KoinComponents.
* Panels implement the Panel interface.
